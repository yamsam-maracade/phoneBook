## Objects Practice

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript constructors and prototypes
to model real-world data.

### Business Logic
- Contact and AddressBook objects manage an address book
- Place objects store information about places visited
- Task and TaskList objects manage a to-do list

### Testing
All business logic was developed using test-driven development.
Tests verify:
- Object creation
- Prototype methods
- State changes (e.g., task completion)

Tests are written using Jest (or console assertions).
